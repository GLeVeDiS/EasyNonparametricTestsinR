# Easy Non parametric Tests in R
This is a small script in R for performing nonparametric tests to determine 
if there are statistically significant differences between three or more independent groups. 
Additionally, it creates a boxplot visualization of the dataset. 
The script organizes and prints the results of the analysis, making it easier for users to 
interpret and access the findings of the statistical analysis.
